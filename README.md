These scripts reproduce the experiments described in the article:
    
S. Rosenzweig, H.C.M. Holme, R.N. Wilke, D. Voit, J. Frahm and M. Uecker: 
Simultaneous Multi-Slice MRI using Cartesian and Radial FLASH and Regularized Nonlinear Inversion: SMS-NLINV
accepted by Magn. Reson. Med. (7/2017)
arXiv-link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04135

For reconstruction we provide an adapted version of the Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) [1]

____________________________


In each folder the *.sh shell-scripts must be started. 
These scripts require BART XXX__TODO: Describe howto__XXX!

The data can be viewed e.g. with 'view'[2] or be loaded into Matlab or Python using 
the wrappers provided in BART subdirectories './matlab' and './python'

[For Cartesian experiments, the patterns are explicitely provided.]

If you need further help to run the scripts, I am happy to help you: sebastian.rosenzweig@med.uni-goettingen.de
